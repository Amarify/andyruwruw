Hello! Hope you like the profile page README.md.

100% inpsired by [natemoo-re](https://github.com/natemoo-re). I thought what he did was awesome.

I have had a ton of experience working with Spotify's API but the implementation of this into README.md is all based on what he did. I just had to figure out based on his repo how he did it!

The way we're able to make README.md dynamic is by creating a server that generates the images displayed upon request.

From the server, the data is requested and React is used to create the components. It is then sent back to the README.md as an image file.

The server is hosted on Vercel. By creating a folder called `api`, each file is treated as an endpoint.

Hope that helps you get started with making your own cool README.md profile page. :)
